# What is multimedia

* Images and gifs.
* Video documentation.
    * Great for making complicated concepts seem simple.
    * But much more expensive to produce.
* Webinars and recorded trainings.

## When should you make a video?

* Documentation is complete
* Describing complicated concepts
* Long processes with completed UI
* Marketing
* Big revenue clients who want videos
* For internal training

## When to make webinars

* Marketing strategy
* Repetitive internal training
* Process takes 10+ minutes
* Multiple outcomes
* Seeking feedback

## When not to make a video

* No time to learn the software
* Unfinished product, UI changes a lot
* Small audience, low revenue
* When you have no content strategy (so the video would look unprofessional)

# Making a video

## How to write your script

* Tell a story
* Break ideas into sectinos
* Avoid buzzwords and complex language
* Read it out loud and listen to yourself

## Get approval

Just get approval for the whole idea.

## Creating a storyboard

Write the text for each frame/fragment of the video.

Animations at Google:

* A team of three people
* 40-60 hours to create 1 minute video.

## Style and branding

Style guidelines include:

* Logos
* Color
* Typography
* Voice & tone. E.g. “friendly and respective”.
    Voice and tone of a video should match those of the whole company.
    
Be consistent!
Set high expectations and keep to them.

Respect employees like customers and make the same high quality content for them.

## Quality

* Use high quality audio
* Test everything
* Price of the software doesn't mean much, but the skill of the editor (person) is crucial.

# Making a profit

Did the video bring more revenue than cost?

* Analytics for the video
* Analytics in the docs
* Customer service tickets
* Get feedback

# Getting feedback

Active feedback:

* written comments
* thumbs up & down
* clicking some button

Passive feedback

* Collect analytics
* Monitor user behaviour

# Ask the right questions

# Final takeaways

* Be brief
* Get approval
* Use a style guide
* Test everything
* Learning how to use a tool properly is better than spending money on fancy tools
